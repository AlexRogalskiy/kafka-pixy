// T maintains mapping of partition workers that generate requests to broker
// executors that process them. It uses an external resolver to determine a
// particular broker executor instance to assign to a partition worker.
//
// Mapper triggers reassignment whenever one of the following events happen:
//   * it is signaled that a new worker has been spawned via `WorkerSpawned()`;
//   * it is signaled that an existing worker has stopped via `WorkerStopped()`;
//   * a worker explicitly requested reassignment via `WorkerReassign()`
//   * an executor reported connection error via `BrokerFailed()`.
//
// Broker executors are spawned on demand when a broker connection is mapped to
// a partition worker for the first time. It is guaranteed that a broker
// executor is stopped only after all partition workers that used to be assigned
// to it have either been stopped or assigned another broker executor.
